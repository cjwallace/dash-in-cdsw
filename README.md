# Dash

Script to run Plot.ly's [dash](https://dash.plot.ly/) in a CDSW experiment.
Running in an experiment is fine for demo purposes, but should not be considered a "production ready" solution.
The experiment (and hence app) will eventually timeout, and will be using cluster resources in the meantime.
