# Dash

Script to run Plot.ly's [dash](https://dash.plot.ly/) in a CDSW experiment.
Running in an experiment is fine for demo purposes, but should not be considered a "production ready" solution.
The experiment (and hence app) will eventually timeout, and will be using cluster resources in the meantime.

Once the app is running with the CDSW experiment function, visit the "Open Dash" link in the session output of the experiment to see the app.
